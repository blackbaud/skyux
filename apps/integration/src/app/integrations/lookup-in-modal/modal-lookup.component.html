      you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.

      Think different. Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The
      troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things

      status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify
