Your goal is to have two empty mixins at the top of the scss file for the component.

Add compat mixins:

- Ensure that the import `@use 'libs/components/theme/src/lib/styles/compat-tokens-mixins' as compatMixins;` is within the imports of the scss file for the component.
- Include the mixin `compatMixins.sky-default-overrides` outside of any selectors with a parameter of the wrapping css class from the HTML file or `TODO` if none is found.
- Include the mixin `compatMixins.sky-modern-overrides` outside of any selectors with a parameter of the wrapping css class from the HTML file or `TODO` if none is found.
- Make the mixins empty mixins with a comment of `\\ TODO: Add overrides here` inside.
- Ensure both mixins are at the top of the file directly below the imports for the scss file and before any other selectors.
- Add a single line break between the two mixins.
